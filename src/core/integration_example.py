üéØ Key Benefits of the Enhanced System:

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Uses vector similarity to determine relevance
   - Understands context and meaning, not just keywords
   - Adapts to any knowledge base content automatically

2. **Follow-up Detection**: Recognizes conversation patterns
   - Short questions like "what about..." are treated as follow-ups
   - Pronouns and references are handled intelligently

3. **Academic Question Recognition**: Identifies learning-oriented questions
   - "What", "How", "Why" questions are generally allowed
   - Educational patterns are recognized across domains

4. **Domain Agnostic**: Works with any PDF/document collection
   - No hardcoded keywords for specific subjects
   - Automatically learns from the loaded knowledge base

5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation
   - If semantic search fails, uses pattern-based backup
   - Errs on the side of being helpful rather than restrictive

üìö Usage for Different Domains:
- Medical textbooks ‚Üí Medical Q&A tutor
- Computer science papers ‚Üí Programming tutor  
- History documents ‚Üí History tutor
- Legal documents ‚Üí Legal research assistant
- Any domain ‚Üí Intelligent domain-specific tutor
