    **BINARY EVALUATION** (40% of overall score): 
    Classify the student's answer into ONE of the following categories:
    - `correct`: Complete understanding, accurate application
    - `partially_correct`: Substantial understanding, minor errors
    - `incorrect_but_related`: Some relevant thinking, but fundamentally incorrect with major errors
    - `incorrect`: Significant misconceptions or errors
    - `unclear`: Ambiguous or hard to understand
    - `error`: An error occurred during evaluation (e.g., parsing issue)

    **WEIGHTED MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCORES** (60% of overall score):
    Evaluate each dimension 0.0 - 1.0 with specified weights:
        1. **CONCEPTUAL_ACCURACY** (30 % weight):
            - How accurately does the student's answer use the key concept correctly?
            - Are terms and concepts used appropriately and correctly?
        2. **REASONING_COHERENCE** (25 % weight):
            - How logically does the student's reasoning process develop?
            - Do arguments flow logically and connect well?
        3. **USE_OF_EVIDENCE_AND_RULES** (15 % weight):
            - How well does the student's answer use evidence and rules from the context?
            - Are claims, rules and principles supported by relevant evidence from the context?
        4. **CONCEPTUAL_INTEGRATION** (20 % weight):
            - How much does the student's answer integrate multiple concepts, linking them together?
            - Does the answer show a deep understanding of how concepts relate to each other?
        5. **CLARITY_OF_EXPRESSION** (10 % weight):
            - How clearly does the student express their reasoning and ideas?
            - Is the answer well-structured, easy to comprehend and free of ambiguity?

3.  **Concept Question:** The student is expressing a deeper lack of understanding about an underlying concept, principle, or the "why" behind something.

4.  **Confusion / Frustration:** The student is expressing general confusion, frustration, or is simply stating they don't know without asking a specific question. This is a signal of being overwhelmed.
